# django-real-estate-project

A personal project I worked on during the summer of 2020. I started this project to learn more about Django, hosting, and SSH keys. I used a Digital Ocean droplet to host the server and installed all dependencies by signing into the server using an SSH key.

Features:
- Create, edit, and delete Real Estate listings and Realtors
- Search for listings through specific filters (bedrooms, price, keyword, etc)
- Secure account creation, users who are logged in have access to a dashboard
- Send inquiries about a listing to the realtor, logged in users have their inquiries saved in the dashboard
- Admin page (accessible by staff), used to manage all listings, realtors, accounts, and logs all events.

Tools and Technologies Used:
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- Digital Ocean
- Bootstrap

Languages:
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
